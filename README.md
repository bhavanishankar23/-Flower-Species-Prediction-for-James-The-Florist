# Flower-Species-Prediction-for-James-The-Florist
A simple classification model to predict whether a flower should be used for personal gifting, decoration or potpourri based on the dimesions of petals and sepals.

# Problem Statement
A florist named James had set up his small flower business in the Brooklyn area of New York in 2015, and over the years, his business had grown into a decent size and he was able to take in big orders including events like weddings. Suddenly, in March 2020, he faced a huge hit in revenue. With the pandemic around, he lost the majority of his customers who would come in to buy flowers in person, for their loved ones. In the urge to maximize his profit, he also identified another major problem. It was the wastage of flowers due to a lack of desirability. Oftentimes, a large number of flowers would be shipped to decorators that would be too small or skinny to be used in decorations. In turn, they would have to be returned or thrown out and James would have to send them more flowers.

This model has been built for James on a small subset of flowers (Iris) as an experiment. It predicts whether James should:
* Reserve the flowers for selling to customers for personal gifting
* Export them to Event Decorators
* Export them to Potpourri Businesses

# Model Performance
The accuracy came out to be 98%, with good precision and recall values

# Conclusion
How does this model help James?

It helps in the followinf ways:
* Reduce manual task to identify segregate flowers as it is cumbersome to compare dimensions each time
* Reduce wastage as flowers would be categorized into proper categories
